<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello World!<br />
  My name is Hafizh Sidqi. But people usually call me Hafizh or Apis if they're
  close enough to me lol. I'm currently 24 years old (going 25 in a few months
  as of now). Right now I just got bachelor's degree from University of
  Indonesia majoring in Geography.
</p>

<p>
  There is one reason that I started to learn programming because I wasn't sure
  enough about my future. To be completely honest, I'm just an average student
  and I just realized that geography isn't really my passion or my strong suit.
  I really hope by learning web development I can find my passion and help me
  for my career in the future.
</p>

<p>
  For anyone seeing this, I hope you can learn a bit about me and maybe we can
  share about lots of things that we want to talk. I'm really eager to be a
  professional web developer so I can be a better person career wise and hope to
  get things going in my life. Hope you all happy to find me!
